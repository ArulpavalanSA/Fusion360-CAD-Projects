# 🛠️ Fusion 360 / SolidWorks CAD Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of 3D modeling and mechanical design projects!  
This repository showcases my work using **Fusion 360** and **SolidWorks**, covering basic part modeling, assembly, and 2D drafting skills developed through coursework and self-practice.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- ✅ 3D Models of mechanical components  
- ✅ Section views and dimensioned drawings  
- ✅ Fusion 360 (.f3d) and STEP (.step) files  
- ✅ PDF references and images of completed models  
- ✅ Skills: Sketch, Extrude, Revolve, Fillet, Mirror, Cut, Draft, Assembly

## 📌 Units

All designs use **MMGS units** (millimeter, gram, second).
